\title{Needleman–Wunsch Global Sequence Alignment (Rcpp version)}
\usage{
needleman_wunsch_cpp(seq1, seq2, match = 1, mismatch = -1, gap = -2)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq1}{A character string representing the first sequence (e.g., DNA, RNA, or protein).}

\item{seq2}{A character string representing the second sequence.}

\item{match}{Numeric score for a match between two characters. Default is 1.}

\item{mismatch}{Numeric penalty for a mismatch between two characters. Default is -1.}

\item{gap}{Numeric penalty for a gap (insertion or deletion). Default is -2.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{score}{The optimal alignment score (numeric).}
  \item{score_matrix}{The dynamic programming score matrix (numeric matrix).}
  \item{traceback_matrix}{The matrix storing traceback directions ("diag", "up", "left").}
  \item{alignment}{A character vector of length 2 containing the aligned sequences.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the optimal global alignment between two sequences using the
Needleman–Wunsch algorithm with a simple scoring scheme.
}
\details{
The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm initializes a scoring matrix with gap penalties,
fills it via dynamic programming, and performs a traceback to recover the
optimal global alignment. Time and space complexity are both O(n*m).

res <- needleman_wunsch_cpp("GATTACA", "GATAAA")
